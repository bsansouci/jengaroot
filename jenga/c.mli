(** returns (an overapproximation of) the list of header files used when preprocessing
    [source]. This includes transitive inclusions, even across buildable header files.
    The strings produced are (inferred) relative includes, as written in the
    #include directives. They are to be interpreted relative to the include search path
    as specified by [flags].

    It will bring any required header files up to date,
    but will not register action dependency on those files.
    Use [known_deps] to register action dependency.

   Establish dependencies on all potential locations for a known set of

   in the #include <...> directive (normally inferred by [deps]).
